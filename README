KrakSnow
Mike Perron(2014)

A cute snow effect for your page. Read the comments in the javascript
source for more information about using this.

You should include this source file in the head of your HTML document
like this:

	<script type=text/javascript src=KrakSnow.js></script>

In order for the snow effect to render, it needs a pair of canvases. In
your body, add:

	<canvas id=snowscape style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; z-index: -1"></canvas>
	<canvas id=snowscape2 style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; z-index: -1"></canvas>

The snow is configurable. Look at KrakSnow.scene to see what parameters
may be applied.
