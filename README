KrakSnow
Mike Perron(2014)

A cute snow effect for your page. Read the comments in the javascript
source for more information about using this.

You should include this source file:

	<script type=module src=KrakSnow.js></script>

Somewhere in your page body:

	<krak-snow r=100 g=100 b=100></krak-snow>

The r, g, and b attributes color the percentage of that color present in
the flakes. These attributes may be ommitted and default to 100.
